Developer test as part of my Novafutur Full Stack Developer application. 

As I'm working full time and in the process of completing other technical tests right now, I didn't get to put in as much time as I would have liked. 

All functional requirements were met, but the presentation could be improved on.

The main lesson I took from this was to spend more time planning the structure of the App. Ideally, I would have used context in the App component to send timer information to the Timer and ForecastList components. Instead, I set up two separate timers in each of these components as I didn't have the time to re-design the app. 

I enjoyed the process and learned a lot from it. 

**To Run**

Download the repository as a zip file. 

Open the folder in React and start a new terminal.

run

'npm install'

then 

'npm start'

this should open the project in a localhost domain.
